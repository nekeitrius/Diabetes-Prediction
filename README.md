# Diabetes-Prediction


This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting diabetes in individuals based on 
various factors such as sex, cholesterol levels, hypertension, age, smoking habits, physical health, and more. The 
goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis and 
intervention for individuals at risk of developing diabetes.

Project Overview
In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual developing 
diabetes based on various input features. The ultimate goal was to create a model that can aid healthcare professionals 
in identifying high-risk patients and initiating appropriate preventive measures.


Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of anonymized patient records, containing relevant attributes such as 
sex, cholesterol levels, hypertension, age, smoking habits, physical health, and other potential risk factors. The 
dataset is included in this repository and can also be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prosperchuks/health-dataset?resource=download .


Dependencies
To run this project locally, the following dependencies are required:
-Python 3.x
-Jupyter Notebook
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Scikit-learn
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Sklearn
-joblib


Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt 

Usage
Follow these steps to use this project:
1. Ensure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies.
2. Obtain the dataset 
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and generate predictions.

Model Training
The notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb contains detailed explanations and code for the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, scaling, etc.
2. Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing and understanding the distribution and relationships between 
variables.
3. Model selection: Trying out various machine learning algorithms and selecting the most suitable one for the
task.
4. Model training: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model, and optimizing 
hyperparameters.
5. Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
Evaluation
I evaluated the performance of this model based on pipeline modeling. 

Results
The results obtained from the trained model are summarized in the pdf document "Predicting Diabetes". This 
includes performance metrics, visualizations, and insights gained from the analysis of the dataset.
